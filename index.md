## About Me

Hi, I am xFelienDev (also known as Aja on the WRD Forum). I am a intermediate C# programmer, begginer Node.JS, C++ and PHP developer and young website designer. I am currently trying to learn to code by myself, however situations may happen in which I will need to get a little help by using someone else's codes, which I think is allowed and should not be hated, if the original creator of the code does allow that and releases it as open source.

If you need help, you can contact me on WeAreDevs by sending me a message or Discord (poopbob7#0918), but getting a response from me on there might take a while since I do not have much time to check it.

### Some of my projects

Since I am a programmer, you think I have some projects that I am working on or have made. And you're right, I have made one and I am currently working on it, called [Carmel](https://dsc.gg/crml) which is a Roblox scripting software which can be used to learn Lua and grow your Lua skills.

If you'd like to hire me to work for your project / you, feel free to message me via contacts given before. Keep in mind any tips are appreciated.

### What are your passions?

My current passion is programming, but if we're talking the real life passions, then **basketball**. I don't do much sports generally, if anything, it's basketball. If you ask me if I am good in it, well, let's say 50/50.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble with your code? Need help with your project? I will try to help you as good as it is possible for me. I understand people that are trying to get help from others. Some say it's spoonfeeding - however I call it **helping**. We all started from nothing. Now, let's share our knowledge with others.
